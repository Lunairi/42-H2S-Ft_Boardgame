# 42-H2S-Ft_Boardgame
A project I made for high school hack, a 42 high school curriculum that teaches students to program. This is the second project for teaching object oriented programming written in Ruby or Python.


Ft_Boardgame Concepts: (T2)

NOTE: SUBJECTIVE TO CHANGES DUE, PROJECT MAYBE TOO DIFFICULT FOR HIGHSCHOOLERS LEARNING RUBY OR PYTHON

Requirements:
Stupid are expected to create a game container class that will 
run their boardgame. As with all OOP project you are expected to
create the following:
- 1) At least 4 powerup/game event cards for your boardgame. They must
all be children classes that inherits from the same parent class.
- 2) Must support at least two players on the boardgame, and players
can gain and have powerup/game event cards equipped to their player class.
- 3) Player classes are considered children class and must inherit from the
same parent class separate from the card classes.
- 4) There will be a dice class (doesn't matter for parent or children) that
will be used to allow players to roll a number and move on the board.
- 5) Some graphic library will be used for interface (TBD)
- 6) Players will be given an option to use a powerup/game event card that they
received, or be able to just roll the dice and end their turn.
- 7) Boardgame must have a minimum of 40 tiles, a win condition, and at least
half the tile must contain some sort of event
- 7a) Each tile of course is a children class that must inherit from the same parent class


Project Detail:
Students will be creating a simple boardgame! The gameplay and rules is up 
to the student however there are some restrictions that must occur for the project
to be considered valid.
- 1) There must be 40 tiles with half of the tiles are some sort of event
- 2) There must be a win condition
- 3) You must allow at least two players to play
- 4) You must implement powerup/game event cards that players can earn through playing
- 5) Players will be given an option to use those cards or roll the dice
- 6) Boardgame and player markers will be made on ncurses

Bonus:
Additional players, additional events, bigger boardgame, additional mechanism, sounds, etc.
