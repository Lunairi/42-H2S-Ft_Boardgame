# 42-H2S-Ft_Boardgame
A project I made for high school hack, a 42 high school curriculum that teaches students to program. This is the second project for teaching object oriented programming written in Ruby or Python.

We were required to:

Write a pdf with detail instructions on how to complete the project and what is required
- To write a grading scale for the students for when they turn in their project
- To come up and design a unique project for the students
- To create video tutorial with example code and a set script
- To recreate our own created project to demo and show to students

Ft_Boardgame Concepts: (T2)

Requirements:
Stupdents are expected to create a game container class that will 
run their boardgame. As with all OOP project you are expected to
create the following:
- 1) At least 3 powerup/game event cards for your boardgame. They must
all be children classes that inherits from the same parent class.
- 2) Must support at least two players on the boardgame, and players
can gain and have powerup/game event cards equipped to their player class.
- 3) Must use a game entity class/container to help facilitate the game process
- 4) Player class can be designed freely, however they must be able to 
equip powerup/game event cards
will be used to allow players to roll a number and move on the board.
- 5) You must design some sort of graphic output
- 6) Players will be given an option to use a powerup/game event card that they
received, or be able to just roll the dice and end their turn.


Project Detail:
Students will be creating a simple boardgame! The gameplay and rules is up 
to the student however there are some restrictions that must occur for the project
to be considered valid.
- 1) There must be minimum of 3 unique children for tile/space and card/item
- 2) Proper children/parent class inheritance is required
- 3) There must be a win condition
- 4) You must allow at least two players to play
- 5) You must implement powerup/game event cards that players can earn through playing
- 6) Players will be given an option to use those cards or roll the dice
- 7) Students will have the freedom to design any graphical output

Bonus:
Additional players, additional events, bigger boardgame, additional mechanism, sounds, etc.

Video Lessons:
- 1) Class entities/containers and array of classes
- 2) Extending class methods, Modules
